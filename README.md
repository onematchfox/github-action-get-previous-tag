# Get previous tag

Github Action that gets the latest tag from git

![Example output showing this action in action](images/output.png)

## Output

This action outputs 2 outputs - the current tag, both prefixed with v and without. If the current tag is prefixed with `v` then this will be stripped in the `tag` output. For example, given the input `v1.2.3` or `1.2.3` the same values will be output:

- `tag`: `1.2.3`
- `v_tag`: `v1.2.3`

When no tag is found or another error occurs it exits with code `1`.

## Example

The following example works together with the [`WyriHaximus/github-action-next-semvers`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/next-semvers) 
and [`WyriHaximus/github-action-create-milestone`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/create-milestone) actions. 
Where it provides the previous tag from that action so it can supply a set of versions for the next action, which 
creates a new milestone. (This snippet has been taken from the automatic code generation of [`wyrihaximus/fake-php-version`](https://github.com/wyrihaximus/php-fake-php-version/).)

```yaml
name: Generate

  generate:
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: 'Get Previous tag'
        id: previoustag

        env:

      - name: 'Get next minor version'
        id: semvers
        uses: "WyriHaximus/github-action-next-semvers@master"
        with:
          version: ${{ steps.previoustag.outputs.tag }}
      - name: 'Create new milestone'
        id: createmilestone
        uses: "WyriHaximus/github-action-create-milestone@master"
        with:
          title: ${{ steps.semvers.outputs.patch }}
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
```
